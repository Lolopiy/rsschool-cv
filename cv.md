Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. 
As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in web development. \
For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. \
In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.\
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.
